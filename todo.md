TODO:

  a. The order of the content on mobile is not cool: 
  text-image, image-text. On Laptop
  text-image, text-image. On Mobile. This is what I want 
  b. Change the media-query @media screen and (max-width: 1024px) to that of mobile. so that the portfolio media can be row on tablet.  Change the media-query @media screen and (max-width: 1024px) to that of mobile. 

  ii. Home
  a.
  b. Remove the white background from the  icons (gmail, fb, linkedin, twitter) or u can search for transparent icons this is because on mobile they are on my cloth(which color is blue) so the white background shows
  c. Change the media-query @media screen and (max-width: 1024px) to that of mobile.It is currently that of tablet. so that the display can be column only on mobile and not on tablet for cv button and about button


NOT SURE OF THE NEED TO DO IT:
i. Home
 a.  The page overflows the container because of two things(the images and the header)
    I commented out the images to be able to fix the button that is not responsive
ii. Portfolio
